# VBA-challenge
Repository for Module 2 VBA Challenge

This VBA Module Challenge involved looking at the stock prices of different stocks over the year within three seperate years. I had taken the opening price and the closing price of each company's stock and calculated the change in price from the beginning to the end of the year. I then calculated that change as a percent from the beginning of the year to the end. Finally I calculated the total stock volume for each stock throughout the year.
I had also created a table that would state stocks with the greatest percentage increase, the greatest percentage decrease and the greatest total volume throughout the year.


# 2018

This is the results of the 2018 stocks. The cells with positive changes of the year are filled in with green and the negative changes are filled in with red. The greatest percentage increase is THB with an increase of 141.42% and the greatest percentage decrease is RKS with a decrease of -90.02%. The greatest total volume between all the stocks in 2018 is QKN with a total volume of 1,689,539,560,106.
