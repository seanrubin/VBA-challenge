Repository for Module 2 VBA Challenge

This VBA Module Challenge involved looking at the stock prices of different stocks over the year within three seperate years. I had taken the opening price and the closing price of each company's stock and calculated the change in price from the beginning to the end of the year. I then calculated that change as a percent from the beginning of the year to the end. Finally I calculated the total stock volume for each stock throughout the year.
I had also created a table that would state stocks with the greatest percentage increase, the greatest percentage decrease and the greatest total volume throughout the year.
